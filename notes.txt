Some brief notes.

As a learning exercise I'm trying to build a (really, really) simple RPG-style mini-game.

A player character will fight a series of enemies until dead.

All characters have attributes and strategies. During each encounter, each participant is prompted to choose an action.

Based on a strategy each character will perform an action ('attack', 'flee', etc). This may involve passing 'attack'
objects to other participants, which resolve them and pass a result back.

This continues until one or both characters are dead.
